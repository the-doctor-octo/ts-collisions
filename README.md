Polygons collision detection case study

This repo contains a simple demo that displays a number of polygons on a 2d Canvas.
The scope is to study the SAT (separating axis theorem) and its implications.

I hope you can find this entertaining and useful to gain some knowledge.

How to use:

Q - cycles the selection of the polygon to move

W-A-S-D - moves the polygon
